          <mj-text mj-class="white h2" align="center">What's actually in Australia's encryption laws?</mj-text>
          <mj-image src="https://protonmail.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/protonmail-australia-anti-encryption-law.jpg"></mj-image>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Labor caved in last Thursday. Despite spending hours telling Parliament why the Assistance and Access Bill was dangerous garbage, and complaining about the rushed process, they dropped all of their proposed amendments and voted in the sitting government's version anyway. The most controversial part is the "frameworks for voluntary and mandatory industry assistance to law enforcement and intelligence agencies" to help government access the content of encrypted communications.</mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Under the new laws, Australian government agencies can issue three kinds of notices: Technical Assistance Notices (TAN), which are compulsory notices for a "designated communication provider" to use an interception capability they already have; Technical Capability Notices (TCN), which are compulsory notices for a designated communication provider to build a new interception capability, so that it can meet subsequent Technical Assistance Notices; and Technical Assistance Requests (TAR), which are "voluntary" requests, but which have been described by experts as the most dangerous of the three because there was less oversight, at least in the original version of the law.</mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Is this about fighting terrorism and child abuse? Kinda. It includes any crime "punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 3 years or more or for life". ASIS can also ask for assistance in relation to "the interests of Australia's foreign relations or the interests of Australia's national economic well-being".</mj-text>
          <mj-text color="#fff">Who's impacted? Pretty much anyone and everyone who provides any kind of online service or communications equipment to anyone in Australia, and anyone who even installs or maintains the kit. Yes, that includes anyone who has a website.</mj-text>

          <mj-image src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-453920612-800x533.jpg"></mj-image>
          <mj-text>Google said it discovered another critical security vulnerability in one of Google+'s People APIs that could have allowed developers to steal private information on 52.5 million users, including their name, email address, occupation, and age.</mj-text>
          <mj-text>The vulnerable API in question is called "People: get" that has been designed to let developers request basic information associated with a user profile .However, software update in November introduced the bug in the Google+ People API that allowed apps to view users' information even if a user profile was set to not-public. Google engineers discovered the security issue during standard testing procedures and addressed it within a week of the issue being introduced.</mj-text>
          <mj-text>The company said it found no evidence that the vulnerability was exploited or its users' data was misused by any third-party app developers. Google also assured its users that no passwords, financial data, national identification numbers or any other sensitive data were left exposed by this API bug. Google said the company is going to shut down its social media network in April 2019 instead of August.</mj-text>
